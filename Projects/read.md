# Data Analysis and Modeling Documentation

## 1. Importing Required Libraries
The code begins by importing the necessary libraries for data analysis and modeling. These libraries include pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, and scikit-learn modules.

## 2. Loading and Inspecting the Data
The code reads the data from a CSV file named __'merged.csv'__ into a pandas DataFrame object called df. It then displays the first few rows of the DataFrame, shape of the DataFrame, and column names using the head(), shape, and columns methods.

## 3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
*  __`Convert Columns to Numeric:`__ The code converts each column in the DataFrame to numeric type using the pd.to_numeric function with the __errors='coerce'__ parameter. This helps to ensure that all columns contain numerical data.

* __`Remove '\t' from Column Names:`__ The code removes any __'\t'__ characters from the column names using the str.replace method. This is done to clean up the column names.

* __`Handling Missing Values:`__ The code checks for null values in the DataFrame using the isnull().sum() method and drops rows with null values using the dropna() method. This ensures that the data is free of missing values.

* __`Handling Duplicates:`__ The code checks for duplicate rows in the DataFrame using the duplicated().sum() method and drops duplicate rows using the drop_duplicates() method. This ensures that each row in the DataFrame is unique.

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* __`Box Plot:`__ The code creates a box plot using the Seaborn library (sns.boxplot) to visualize the distribution and identify outliers in selected columns. The box plot is displayed using Matplotlib.

* __`Histogram:`__ The code creates a histogram using Seaborn (sns.histplot) to visualize the frequency distribution of the 'CPU cores' column.

* __`Correlation Heatmap:`__ The code calculates the correlation matrix of selected columns using the corr() method and creates a heatmap using Seaborn (sns.heatmap) to visualize the correlation between variables.

## 5. Outlier Detection and Removal
The code performs outlier detection using z-scores. It defines a z-score threshold and calculates the z-scores for each column using the stats.zscore function. Rows with z-scores above the threshold are considered outliers and are removed from the DataFrame. The resulting DataFrame without outliers is stored in a new variable called df_no_outliers.

## 6. Data Scaling
The code scales the data using the StandardScaler from scikit-learn (sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler). It standardizes the numerical features in the df_no_outliers DataFrame by fitting the scaler on the data and transforming the features. The scaled data is stored in a new DataFrame called df_scaled.

## 7. Splitting the Data
The code splits the data into training and test sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn (sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split). The features are assigned to X, and the target variable is assigned to y. The data is split into 80% for training and 20% for testing, with a random state of 42.

## 8. Model Evaluation and Comparison
The code evaluates and compares the performance of three regression models: Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regression, and Decision Tree Regressor.

* __`Random`__ Forest Regressor: The code creates a Random Forest Regressor with 100 estimators (n_estimators=100) and fits it to the training data. It then predicts the target variable on the test data and calculatesthe __mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE)__ using the mean_squared_error and mean_absolute_error functions from scikit-learn's sklearn.metrics module. The predictions are compared to the actual values, and the evaluation metrics are printed and displayed using a bar plot created with Seaborn.

* __`Linear`__ Regression: The code creates a Linear Regression model (LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model) and fits it to the training data. It then predicts the target variable on the test data and calculates the evaluation metrics. The metrics are printed and displayed using a bar plot.

* __`Decision`__ Tree Regressor: The code creates a Decision Tree Regressor (DecisionTreeRegressor from sklearn.tree) and fits it to the training data. It then predicts the target variable on the test data and calculates the evaluation metrics. The metrics are printed and displayed using a bar plot.

* __`Ridge Regressor`__: The code creates a Ridge Regressor (Ridge from sklearn.linear_model) and fits it to the training data. It then predicts the target variable on the test data and calculates the evaluation metrics. The metrics are printed and displayed using a bar plot.

## 9. Conclusion
The code provides an end-to-end data analysis and modeling pipeline. It starts with loading and inspecting the data, performs data cleaning and preprocessing, conducts exploratory data analysis, detects and removes outliers, scales the data, splits it into train and test sets, and evaluates multiple regression models. The evaluation metrics are printed and displayed using bar plots for easy comparison.


# Reinforcement Learning with Gym Environment Documentation

## 1. Importing Required Libraries
The code starts by importing the necessary libraries for reinforcement learning, including gym and numpy.

## 2. Defining a Custom Gym Environment
The code defines a custom Gym environment named CustomEnv by subclassing __gym.Env__. The environment is initialized with a DataFrame df, and various attributes are defined:

* __`current_step:`__ Tracks the current step in the environment.
* __`max_steps:`__ Represents the maximum number of steps in the environment.
* __`action_space:`__ Defines the action space as gym.spaces.Discrete(2) to represent two discrete actions.
* __`observation_space:`__ Defines the observation space as gym.spaces.Box(low=0, high=1, shape=(4,)) to represent a continuous observation space with four dimensions.

The environment provides the following methods:

* __`reset:`__ Resets the environment to the initial state and returns the initial observation.
* __`step:`__ Performs an action in the environment, updates the state, calculates the reward, and returns the new observation, reward, done flag, and additional information.
* __`get_observation:`__ Retrieves the observation at the current step from the DataFrame.
* __`calculate_reward:`__ Calculates the reward based on the current state and action.

## 3. Loading and Preprocessing the Data
The code loads the preprocessed data from the __"cleaned.csv"__ file into a DataFrame named df. For demonstration purposes, the number of rows in df is reduced to 500.

## 4. Creating and Training the Agent
The code creates an instance of the custom environment (CustomEnv) using the preprocessed data (df). It then trains the agent through a specified number of episodes (num_episodes). In each episode, the environment is reset, and actions are selected randomly (env.action_space.sample()) for demonstration purposes. The agent interacts with the environment by performing actions, receiving observations, rewards, and done flags, and updating its state accordingly.

## 5. Evaluating the Agent
After training, the code evaluates the agent's performance by running a specified number of evaluation episodes (num_eval_episodes). In each evaluation episode, the environment is reset, and actions are selected randomly (env.action_space.sample()) for demonstration purposes. The total reward accumulated throughout the episode is calculated and stored in episode_rewards. Finally, the mean reward across all evaluation episodes is calculated and printed.

Overall, the provided code demonstrates a basic reinforcement learning setup with a custom Gym environment. The agent interacts with the environment by taking actions, receiving observations and rewards, and using them to learn and improve its performance over multiple episodes.
